# GitHub Actions Workflow Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved âœ…

**Problem**: The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with:


```
Error: Missing download info for actions/upload-artifact@v3
```


## Root Cause

GitHub deprecated older versions of actions, specifically v3 of several core actions.

## Solution Applied


### 1. Updated Action Versions

- `actions/setup-python@v4` â†’ `actions/setup-python@v5`
- `actions/cache@v3` â†’ `actions/cache@v4`
- `actions/upload-artifact@v3` â†’ `actions/upload-artifact@v4`

- `actions/download-artifact@v3` â†’ `actions/download-artifact@v4`

### 2. Enhanced Python Compatibility

- Updated Python version in workflow: `3.10` â†’ `3.11`

- Expanded Python version constraint: `>=3.10,<3.13` â†’ `>=3.10,<3.14`
- This ensures compatibility with the latest PyInstaller versions

### 3. Added Robustness Features

- **Verification Steps**: Check executable exists before upload

- **Better Error Handling**: Platform-specific verification (Unix vs Windows)

- **Enhanced Debugging**: More detailed output for troubleshooting
- **Improved Checksums**: Better artifact detection and checksum generation

### 4. Created Test Workflow

Added `test-build.yml` for testing builds without creating releases:


- Manual trigger with platform selection
- Shorter artifact retention (7 days vs 30)
- Same build process, testing only

## Files Modified


### Updated

- `.github/workflows/build-executables.yml` - Main build workflow
- `pyproject.toml` - Python version constraint
- `poetry.lock` - Updated with new constraints
- `BUILD_EXECUTABLES.md` - Added troubleshooting section

### Added  

- `.github/workflows/test-build.yml` - Test workflow

## Verification âœ…

1. **Local Build Test**: Successfully built and tested executable locally
2. **Version Compatibility**: Confirmed PyInstaller works with Python 3.11
3. **Action Versions**: All actions now use supported, current versions
4. **Cross-Platform**: Workflow supports all target platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS x64, macOS ARM64)


## Next Steps

1. **Commit Changes**: All workflow fixes are ready to commit
2. **Test Workflow**: Use the new test workflow to verify builds
3. **Create Release**: When ready, push a version tag to trigger full release workflow


## Usage

### Test Build (No Release)

```bash
# Go to GitHub Actions â†’ Test Build Workflow â†’ Run workflow
# Select platform or leave empty for all platforms
```

### Full Release

```bash
# Tag and push
git tag v2.0.1
git push origin v2.0.1

# Or use the release script
poetry run python release.py 2.0.1 --push
```

The workflow is now robust, modern, and ready for production use! ðŸš€
