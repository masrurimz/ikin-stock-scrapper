# Share Buy-Back UAT Summary
## July 7, 2025 - User Acceptance Testing Results

### üéØ UAT Scope
Testing the Share Buy-Back feature (menu option 8) implementation with real PSE Edge data to validate:
- Amendment report handling
- Transaction data extraction accuracy  
- Data aggregation correctness
- Output format completeness

### üìã Test Case: ALI Company (ID: 180)

**Test Scenario:** Extract share buyback data for Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) focusing on July 7, 2025 reports

**Expected Behavior:**
- Capture most recent amended report: "[Amend-1]Share Buy-Back Transactions"
- Correctly aggregate 10 individual transactions totaling 1,400,000 shares
- Detect amendment status with `is_amended_report=True`
- Extract complete financial and contact information

### üîç UAT Findings (Screenshots: SS1.jpeg, SS2.jpeg)

**Issue 1: Amendment Report Selection**
- **Problem:** Original implementation stopped at first report, missing amended version
- **Evidence:** Two reports on Jul 7, 2025 - 08:14 AM (original) and 12:19 PM ([Amend-1])
- **Expected:** Capture 12:19 PM amended version with 1,400,000 shares

**Issue 2: Transaction Aggregation**  
- **Problem:** Multiple Jul 4, 2025 transactions showing consolidated total
- **Evidence:** Screenshot shows 1,400,000 shares as sum of multiple individual transactions
- **Expected:** Proper aggregation with individual transaction details preserved

**Issue 3: Amendment Detection**
- **Problem:** Missing amendment tracking in data output
- **Evidence:** "[Amend-1]" prefix in template name not captured
- **Expected:** `is_amended_report` field to indicate amended documents

### ‚úÖ Resolution Actions Taken

**1. Removed Stop Iteration Behavior**
```diff
- elif report_type == ReportType.SHARE_BUYBACK and not self.stop_iteration:
+ elif report_type == ReportType.SHARE_BUYBACK:
     # Process all reports including amendments
-    if result:
-        self.stop_iteration = True
```

**2. Enhanced Amendment Detection**
```python
is_amended = ("[Amend" in page_content or "Amend-" in page_content or 
             "amended" in page_content.lower() or "amendment" in page_content.lower())
```

**3. Added Amendment Tracking Field**
```python
result = {
    "stock_name": stock_name,
    "disclosure_date": report_date,
    "is_amended_report": is_amended  # New field
}
```
