# Share Buy-Back Feature - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

Add support for scraping Share Buy-Back Transactions from the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) Edge platform to the existing PSE Data Scraper tool. This will become the 8th menu option in the interactive CLI.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

Currently, the PSE Data Scraper supports 5 report types (Public Ownership, Quarterly, Annual, Top 100 Stockholders, Cash Dividends) but lacks support for Share Buy-Back Transactions, which are important corporate disclosure documents that investors and analysts need for comprehensive financial analysis.

### Opportunity

- **User Request**: Direct user feedback requesting this feature (chat.md shows user saying "what is missing is the share buy back")
- **Market Need**: Share buyback data is crucial for understanding corporate capital allocation strategies
- **Completeness**: Adding this feature makes the tool more comprehensive for PSE data analysis

### Business Goals

1. **User Satisfaction**: Address specific user request for share buyback data
2. **Feature Completeness**: Provide comprehensive PSE disclosure coverage
3. **Competitive Advantage**: Maintain position as complete PSE scraping solution

## User Personas

### Primary User: Financial Analyst

- **Role**: Equity research analyst at investment firm
- **Needs**: Complete corporate disclosure data for analysis
- **Pain Point**: Manual collection of share buyback data from PSE Edge
- **Goal**: Automated extraction of buyback transactions for multiple companies

### Secondary User: Individual Investor

- **Role**: Retail investor tracking portfolio companies
- **Needs**: Access to corporate buyback announcements
- **Pain Point**: Time-consuming manual research on PSE website
- **Goal**: Easy access to buyback data for investment decisions

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

1. **Menu Integration**: Add "8. Share Buy-Back Transactions" to interactive CLI menu
2. **Data Extraction**: Extract share buyback transaction details from PSE Edge
3. **Output Format**: Generate CSV/JSON output matching existing report formats
4. **Processing Modes**: Support all existing modes (single company, bulk processing, direct CLI)

### Data Requirements

Based on sample analysis, extract the following fields:

- **Basic Info**: stock_name, disclosure_date
- **Date Components**: Date Registered, Month, Year, Day
- **Transaction Data**: value_1, value_2, value_3, value_4 (numeric values)
- **Metadata**: Default value of 1 (constant field)

### Functional Specifications

#### F1: CLI Menu Integration

- **Given**: User starts interactive mode
- **When**: User views main menu
- **Then**: Option "8. Share Buy-Back Transactions" appears
- **And**: Selecting option 8 prompts for company input like other options

#### F2: Data Extraction

- **Given**: User selects share buyback report for company ID 180 (sample)
- **When**: System processes the request
- **Then**: System extracts data matching the expected format from sample PDF
- **And**: Returns structured data with all required fields

#### F3: Output Generation

- **Given**: Share buyback data has been extracted
- **When**: System saves results
- **Then**: Files are generated in CSV and/or JSON format
- **And**: Format matches existing report output structure

#### F4: Error Handling

- **Given**: Company has no share buyback disclosures
- **When**: System processes the request
- **Then**: System displays "No data found" message
- **And**: Does not create empty output files

## Non-Functional Requirements
