# Final UI Improvements - Share Buyback Implementation

## ✅ Symbol Search Issues Resolved

The interactive CLI has been improved to prevent user confusion about symbol searches for share buyback reports.

## UI Changes Made

### 1. **Share Buyback Menu (Option 6)**
**Before:**
```
Company Selection Options:
1. Single company by symbol: Enter company symbol (e.g., 'SM', 'BDO')
2. Single company by ID: Enter one company ID (e.g., '5')
3. Bulk processing: Enter company ID range
```

**After:**
```
Company Selection Options:
1. Single company by ID: Enter one company ID (e.g., '180' for ALI)
2. Bulk processing: Enter company ID range
Note: Share buyback reports work best with company IDs, not symbols
```

### 2. **General Search Options**
**Updated with color-coded guidance:**
```
🔍 SEARCH OPTIONS:
  • Company Symbol: SM, BDO, PLDT, etc. (works for most reports)
  • Single Company ID: Any number (1, 2, 3, etc.) (recommended for share buyback)
  • 🚀 BULK PROCESSING: Range of IDs (e.g., 1-100)
```

### 3. **Other Report Types**
**Unchanged - still show all options:**
```
Company Selection Options:
1. Single company by symbol: Enter company symbol (e.g., 'SM', 'BDO')
2. Single company by ID: Enter one company ID (e.g., '5')
3. Bulk processing: Enter company ID range
```

## Benefits
